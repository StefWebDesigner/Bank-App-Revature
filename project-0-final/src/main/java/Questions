Monday
Ask Kyle if I can go over how I did the first database creation
    > he can stop me if I say somethign wrong to understand the exact concept I'm doing wrong
    > then tell me how to fix it >>> so I can copy and practice >>> the abract conceptioalizt is failing me
Then, go over it again with the other variables know how to model it and he can stop me if I'm wrong
This would help me progress and stop being blocked by these sequencal shit blizard

Tutor for other shit question he can't answer

The diffferece between the the regular and authetic constructor
example of using the datastore for one of the example of the of the deposite checking









Problems to fix:
Create Login:
- First and last Name's not entering there if conditions if false
    > The firstName input auto is positive in proceeding to the nexxt line without typying input
- the validators works when true or false >>> with false it showss an error
- Country when false is not directing me back to the intial strceen
- If final validation is false it just leads to excaptions
- Email is showing false to everything! --- it works but not acurate
- Unable to send the data to the server

Bank app:
- Second option is not working
- make all the numbers double
- no overdraft

Login in: (Notes maybe helpful to get started);
- the false sint working




Task:
1) Connect server to the project ( I think I need to import the package for the connection)
- in JBCSUITL >>> 1) What should I put in className - 2) is this safe puttin my password here
2) make the datestore
3) work on the login filtering and validation stuff for the creation sequence
    - first/name validator isn't working
   - email and matches doens't works (https://mailtrap.io/blog/java-email-validation/)
   - None of my checks works? They are ignored completed despite having if conditions to
   stop them
   - Can != apply to int's


Extra Notes for implement in PRoject:
- add with pogos revisions on my projects to employee side
- Integer changeAmt = new Double(changeAmtDbl * 100).intValue();
> for formating the money
- a way to format the input
> System.out.println("Your input: " + input \n\n\n\n\n\n);
- System.out.printf("$%.2f\n",55,55f); //55dollars and 55 cent //learn how to really percise with it
- System.out.printf("Account balance: $" + 55.55f + ". Have a nice day!"; with a message with it


Extra Fancy Stuff:
To add the findal reivew dispaly of the infomation all formated autoamticlly!!!!
